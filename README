Basic thrift demo based on the spec from this outdated blog entry: https://mortenib.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/thrift-and-haskell/

1) setup of the hs-thrift bindings

At the moment, the thrift packages in hackage seems to be broken (at least for me), I solved this by
downloading thrift, descending into lib/hs directory (let stack work out the dependencies), fixed the build and linked
that directory ( to "thrift", see stack.yaml).

2) generate hs thrift service

Execute ./generation.bash which expects a thrift compiler "thrift" in path - either use a system package
("thrift-compiler") or make it yourself with the download in 1)

3) build + test

I suggest using stack.
