Basic thrift demo based on the spec from this outdated blog entry: https://mortenib.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/thrift-and-haskell/

1) setup of the hs-thrift bindings

At the moment, the thrift packages in hackage seems to be broken (at least for me), I solved this by
downloading thrift, descending into lib/hs directory (let stack work out the dependencies), fixed the build and linked
that directory ( to "thrift", see stack.yaml).

2) generate hs thrift service

Execute ./generation.bash which expects a thrift compiler linked to "thrift-compiler" - minor versions do matter
(e.g.: 0.9.3 is not compatible to 0.9.0), probably make it yourself as well, see download in 1).

3) build + test

I suggest using stack.
Start a greeting server and run a client

4) hdfs bindings

Only a client is implemented here - expects a running service under localhost:44444.
